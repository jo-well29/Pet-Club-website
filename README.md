# Pet Club

Pet club was inspired from the style of a Physical Therapy clinic's website. The premise of the site Pet Club is to workout and improve your physical health with your pet or dogs that accompany you throughout your session. (Pet friendly)

## Design
The layout of the site is a single page scroll down with multiple sections. The Navigation bar when clicked takes you directly to the section of the page and "Contact" tab gives you contact information.


## Wins
1. One of the major wins is understanding flexbox and what designing a site takes. 
2. Learning to use javaScript to create a hover over on the icon of Pet Club. 
3. For a first time creating a site, I do enjoy the outcome and know for the next time to have a better plan for the next design.
4. The site came out a lot better than what I originally drafted and created on Adobe XD for the site.
5. Learned a lot of animations and the use of javascript/DOM to create some of the features I envisioned for Pet Club.

## Struggles
1. One of the main struggles is the design layout of the page. A scroll down page with not much content that as not visually appealing. 
2. The Main section image was stretched out in full-size and needed to be resized that was challeging. 
3. The form input bar design took some time to figure out and design it the way I wanted to.



## Technology
The systems used to help create the site were Adobe XD for the mockup/draft of what I wanted to create, Visual Studio Code to create the HTML, CSS and javaScript page.

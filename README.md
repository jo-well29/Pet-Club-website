# Pet Club

Pet club was inspired from the style of a Physical Therapy clinic's website. The premise of the site Pet Club is to workout and improve your physical health with your pet or dogs that accompany you throughout your session. (Pet friendly)

## Design
The layout of the site is a single page scroll down with multiple sections. The Navigation bar when clicked takes you directly to the section of the page and "Contact" tab gives you contact information.


## Struggles and Wins
<p>-One of the main struggles is the design layout of the page. A scroll down page with not much content that was visually appealing. The Main section image was stretched out in full-size and needed to be resized that was challeging. The form input bar design took some time to figure out and design it the way I wanted to. <br/>
-One of the major wins is understanding flexbox and what designing a site takes. For a first time design, I do enjoy the outcome and know for the next time to have a better plan for the next design.</p>
